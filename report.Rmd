## **Motivation**

#### Wildfires in the U.S.

* Cause

* Losses

* Policy

[here](https://www.dosomething.org/us/facts/11-facts-about-wildfires)

#### Goals of our Project

* Visualizing the frequency of fires acrossing states and time from 2005 to 2015

* tbc (about EDA)

* The association among factors and duration of wildfires in CA

## **Initial Questions**

## **Data**

* **`state` and `county` datasets in package `ggplot2`**

  The `state` and `county` dataset are used to plot the map in exploratory analysis and shiny apps.

* **`state.x77` dataset**

  We use `Area` variable to calculate the number of wildfires per square mile
  
* **NOAA Weather Data**

  We use this data to find the association among duration, number of fires and tempreture in riverside, California.

* **1.88 Million US Wildfire. 24 years of geo-referenced wildfire records**

  This data publication contains a spatial database of wildfires that occurred in the United States from 1992 to 2015. This dataset includes 1.88 million geo-referenced wildfire records, representing a total of 140 million acres burned during the 24-year period. We mainly focus on the time period from 2005 to 2015 and the following core data elements: discovery and control date, final fire size, causes of wildfires and a point location.

  The variables we used for analysis are: 

  + `duration` = Burning time in hours calculated by `discovery_date`, `discovery_time`, `cont_data` and `cont_time`.

  + `FIRE_SIZE_CLASS` = Code for fire size based on the number of acres within the final fire perimeter expenditures (A=greater than 0 but less than or equal to 0.25 acres, B=0.26-9.9 acres, C=10.0-99.9 acres, D=100-299 acres, E=300 to 999 acres, F=1000 to 4999 acres, and G=5000+ acres).

  + `STAT_CAUSE_DESCR` = Description of the cause of the fire.
