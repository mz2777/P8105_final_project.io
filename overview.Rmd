## **Motivation**

Wildfire hazards are considered as national threats. On average, more than 700 wildfires occur, over 7 million acres of land were burned down and 26,000 structures were destroyed annually, resulting in substantial economic and environmental losses with a number of fatalities and injuries. Considering the massive and devastating impacts of wildfires on human communities and the ecosystem, we decide to investigate wildfire trends available from our dataset in the hope of understanding how to better prevent and control wildfires. 

## **Data**

* 1.88 Million US Wildfires.24 years of geo-referenced wildfire records   [here](https://www.kaggle.com/rtatman/188-million-us-wildfires)

* NOAA Weather Data

* `state` and `county` datasets in package `ggplot2`

* `state.x77` dataset

## **Initial Questions**

* The frequency of wildfire across the states and time.

* Which cause of fire is the most frequent in the U.S.?

* Is there a relationship among temprature, precipitation, cause of fires, size of fires and duration?

* tbc
