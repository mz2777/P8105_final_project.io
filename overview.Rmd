## **Motivation**

Wildfire hazards are considered as national threats. On average, more than 700 wildfires occur, over 7 million acres of land are burned down and 26,000 structures are destroyed annually, resulting in substantial economic and environmental losses with a number of fatalities and injuries. Considering the massive and devastating impacts of wildfires on human communities and the ecosystem, we decide to investigate wildfire trends available from our dataset in the hope of understanding how to better prevent and control wildfires. 

## **Data**

* 1.88 Million US Wildfires.24 years of geo-referenced wildfire records   [here](https://www.kaggle.com/rtatman/188-million-us-wildfires)

* NOAA Weather Data

* `state` and `county` datasets in package `ggplot2`

* `state.x77` dataset

## **Initial Questions**

* The frequency of wildfire across location and time

* The top cause of wildfire in the U.S. over ten years

* Is there a relationship among temprature, precipitation, cause, size and duration of wildfires?
